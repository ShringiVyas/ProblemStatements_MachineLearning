The two regression lines of a bivariate distribution are:
4x – 5y + 33 = 0 (line of y on x) 20x – 9y – 107 = 0 (line of x on y).
Estimate the value of x when y = 7. Compute the correct answer to one decimal place.

Output Format
In the text box, enter the floating point/decimal value required. Do not lead any leading or trailing spaces. Your answer may look like: 7.2

This is NOT the actual answer - just the format in which you should provide your answer.

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
def x_on_y(y):
    x = (107 + 9*y)/20
    return x
def y_on_x(x):
    y = (4*x + 33)/5
    return y

print(x_on_y(7))
