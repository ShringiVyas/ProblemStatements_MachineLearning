The dataset used for this model is a combination of two sets of MRI images:
1. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection 
2. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahimanshu/figshare-brain-tumor-classification
The first dataset has brain MRI images of 2 classes: Tumor - YES/NO. 
Whereas, the second dataset (figshare) has MRI images of types brain tumor, namely, Meningioma, Glioma, and Pituitary.
The combined dataset for this model has types of brain tumor from figshare dataset and "NO" tumor class from Brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection dataset.

Thus, the model is trained on brain mri images of 4 classes.
