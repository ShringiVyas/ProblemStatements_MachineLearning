Objective
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability.

Task
There are 3 urns: X, Y and Z.

Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.
One ball is drawn from each urn. What is the probability that the  balls drawn consist of 2 red balls and 1 black ball?

Output Format
In the editor below, submit your answer as Plain Text in the form of an irreducible fraction , where  and  are both integers.

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
#P1: Px(red) x Py(red) x Pz(black) = 4/7 * 5/9 * 4/8 = 80/504
#P2: Px(red) x Py(black) x Pz(red) = 4/7 * 4/9 * 4/8 = 64/504
#P3: Px(black) x Py(red) x Pz(red) = 3/7 * 5/9 * 4/8 = 60/504
#P = (80 + 64 + 60) / 504 = 17/43
print('17/42')
