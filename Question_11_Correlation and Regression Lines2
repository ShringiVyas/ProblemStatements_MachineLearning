Here are the test scores of 10 students in physics and history:

Physics Scores  15  12  8   8   7   7   7   6   5   3
History Scores  10  25  17  11  13  17  20  13  9   15
When a student scores 10 in Physics, what is his probable score in History? Compute the answer correct to one decimal place.

Output Format
In the text box, enter the floating point/decimal value required. Do not leave any leading or trailing spaces. Your answer may look like: 5.5
This is NOT the actual answer - just the format in which you should provide your answer
