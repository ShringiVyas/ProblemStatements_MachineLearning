The two regression lines of a bivariate distribution are: 4x – 5y + 33 = 0 and 20x – 9y – 107 = 0. find the variance of y when Sigma x = 3. Compute the correct answer to one decimal place.

def func(sigma_x):
    slope1 = 5/4 #y on x line
    slope2 = 20/9 #x on y line
    var = (slope2/slope1) * sigma_x**2
    return var

print(func(3))
