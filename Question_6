Objective
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability.

Task
In a single toss of  fair (evenly-weighted) -sided dice, find the probability of that their sum will be at most .

Output Format

In the editor below, submit your answer as Plain Text in the form of an irreducible fraction , where  and  are both integers.

Your answer should resemble something like:

3/4  

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
from fractions import Fraction
max_num = 9
count = 0
total_combos = 6**2
dice = range(1,7)

for i in dice:
    for s in dice:
        dice_sum = i+s
        if dice_sum <= max_num:
            count+=1
print(str(Fraction(count, total_combos)))
