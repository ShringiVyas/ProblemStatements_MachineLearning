Halloween is a night of costumes, fun, and candy that takes place every year on October 31. On this day people dress up in various costumes that have a scary overtone and go trick-or-treating to gather candy.
This year, on Halloween, there is a carnival in your neighborhood. Besides the various games, there are also 50 stalls that are selling various products, which fall under various categories.
Your task is to predict the selling price of the products based on the provided features.

1. Data Preprocessing: 
   - Missing values were handled by filling them with the mean.
   - One-hot encoding was applied to categorical variables (grade, loyalty_customer, Product_category).
   - Three columns were dropped, for them to have to relevance with selling price calculation (product_id, stall_no, customer_name, instock_date)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - A correlation matrix/heatmap was plotted to identify the relevant features for the model.
3. Modeling:
   - Data was transformed using `fit_transform`.
   - Polynomial regression and linear regression models were applied, with degree = 4.
4. Testing:
   - The same transformations and modeling were applied to the test file.
5. Performance:
   - The model achieved an R-squared score of 95%, indicating a high level of accuracy in predicting the selling price.
This process reflects strong data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling steps, leading to excellent predictive performance.
