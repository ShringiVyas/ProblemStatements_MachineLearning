Objective
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability.
Task
For a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and their sum is 6 .
Output Format
In the editor below, submit your answer as Plain Text in the form of an irreducible fraction , where  and  are both integers.

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
# sum = 6 and different nos: (1,5), (2, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1)
#sample space = 6*6 = 36
#prob = 4/36
print('1/9')
